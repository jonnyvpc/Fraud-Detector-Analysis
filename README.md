# Fraud-Detector-Analysis
Analyze a Large Dataset of Fraud in Financial Payment Services. Being able to query and visualize large datasets helps provide critical information for which areas need additional investment. This is not limited to financial systems but internal computer information systems as well.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Using the Pandas library, I learned how to explore and make sense of a dataset. In the process, I wrote queries and then visualized those queries in an easily digestible format that is presentable to management.
